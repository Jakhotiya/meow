The Useless (For fun only) reactive library.

Web today uses wonderful libraries like reactjs, knockoutjs, angularjs to build modern UI's.
All of these libraries are  "Reactive". You bind UI elements with your models. When your data changes the UI is updated automatically.
But what goes on behind the scenes? And why should you care?

1. Learning how these javascript frameworks/libraries internally teach 
you a lot about the javascript and the DOM itself. 
2. You can finally begin to understand, why some perform better than others.
3. You can debug weird bugs that seem to be comming from library.
4. And if you think something is missing in the original library you can contribute to it.


What does it take to build such a library?

* [Javascript getters and setters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)

* This is an incomplete list and work in progress. There will be 50 other things added to this list over next 15 days
